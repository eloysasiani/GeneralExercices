# JavaScript Exercises

🧩 I created this exercise repository with JavaScript to help those who are **learning programming** and want to **practice logic, structures, functions, and programming concepts, including object-oriented programming (OOP)** with a focus on modern JavaScript.This repository is ideal for beginners, students, self-taught individuals, or even teachers who want practical examples to teach.

## 🗂 How is the project organized?
This repository is organized by specific learning topics.  
Each topic has its own named folder containing several related exercises.  
All of these topic folders are located inside the main `exercicios/` directory.

There is also a separate folder called `solucoes/`, which mirrors the structure of the `exercicios/` directory (same folder and file names), but contains the proposed solutions for each exercise.
## 🛠 Requirements 
To get the most out of this repository, it's recommended that you have:

✅ Node.js installed (optional):
Allows you to run .js files directly from the terminal, making practice easier without relying on the browser.

✅ A code editor with JavaScript support, such as:

- Visual Studio Code

- Sublime Text

- WebStorm

✅ A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge...) — useful if you prefer testing in the browser's DevTools.

## Why did I do that? 🤔🚀🔥
While I learn JavaScript, I have a lot of difficulties finding good exercises with clear solutions that are well organized 🤯📚. And it's important to practice consistently and truly enhance skills 💪✨.

That's why I decided to create this repository full of JS exercises, with easy-to-follow answers and a structure that helps you practice better every day 🧑‍💻⚡.

Because becoming a great programmer means practicing a lot, understanding deeply, and having the right resources at hand 🛠️🚀. This repository is my way of helping everyone who wants to improve and have fun programming 🎉👩‍💻👨‍💻.

Let's program, learn, and grow together! 🚀🔥🔥🔥
